1. Create a class Shape with attributes length and width. Write a method boolean isSquare() if both sides are equal. If not, throw a custom RuntimeException (say NotASquareException). The main() method should print out this exception message. - {**Shape.java**}
2. Generate an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions and use catch and finally blocks to handle the exception and reset the index value. - {**Arrayexample.java**}    
3. Create a class with two methods method1() and method2(). Method2() should throw a NullPointerException. Call method2() from method1(). method1() should catch the specific exception and transform this into a Custom Exception and throw the custom exception created back to main() method. Main method should print out the message of the caught exception. - {**Main.java**}
